## Vyn 0.1.0

### -- [[ Variables ]] --

```lua

X = 4 -- When creating variables, they'll be by default, public to the rest of the script, ingoring all nesting.
local Y = 7 -- When creating localized [LOCAL] variables, they'll only be accessible to it's nested self, or nests of lower value then it, so if a local variable is made at the very top of a script, on the root level, then it's still accessible, as much as a global variable, due to the nesting config
private Z = 3 -- When creating PRIVATE variabled, they'll only be accessible to their code block, and will automatically be shut off from being accessible, once another block is created.

-- [[ Variable Example ]] --

[[

Apples = 7 <-- Global Variable, Accessible Nested Or Not
private Schools = 3 <-- Private Variable, will be inaccessible after the next code block

{ <-- A Block, Built In Scope Construct that allows for one time data to be transmitted, more information via Vyn's official documentation
  Cars = 17
  print(Apples) <-- Works due to global variable/being at root level
}
print(Cars) <-- Error, Although Cars is a global variable, it was called through a block, making it inaccessible to the rest of the script
print Schools <-- Error, Although in the same root level, the Schools variable was removed as of the last block, mainly used for temporary variables/data.

]]
```

### -- [[ Printing ]] --

When printing, Vyn allows the root function, or help of the parentheses for ease of use.

```lua
print(15) -- Using parentheses, straight after print, identifies it for only stuff inside of it
print 15 -- Same as the previous print type, identifies the stuff to the RIGHT of the print function
print (15 + 2) * 3 -- Although it may look like [* 3] is going to cause an error, due to using a space, after print, it allows it as printing everything to the RIGHT of the function, as said previously.
```


### -- [[ Functions ]] --

When creating/using functions, Vyn allows for an _ease of use_ style.

```lua
function add(a, b) -- Standard Vyn Style
  return a + b
end

-- Brace Style --

func add(a, b) {
  return a + b
}

-- Notes: Func is not required for brace, just one of the 3 ways to write function. Brace is not indent specific

-- Colon Style --

fn add(a, b):
  return a + b

-- Notes: fn, is also, not required for colon, just another one of the 3 ways to write a function. Colon IS indent specific
```
As of coding it for version 0.1.2, I see why coding languages dont do this.
